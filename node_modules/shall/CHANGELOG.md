* **[v0.2.8](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.7...v0.2.8)** (2015-10-23):
  * [doc] `README.md` examples still contained obsolete `-l` switch.
  * [dev] Improved robustness of internal `rreadlink()` function.

* **[v0.2.7](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.6...v0.2.7)** (2015-09-20):
  * [dev] Confusing changelog typos fixed.
  * [dev] Removed post-install command that verifies presence of Bash, because
    `npm` always _prints_ the command during installation, which can be confusing.  

* **[v0.2.6](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.5...v0.2.6)** (2015-09-19):
  * [doc] `shall` now has a man page (if manually installed, use `shall --man`);
          `shall -h` now just prints concise usage information.

* **[v0.2.5](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.4...v0.2.5)** (2015-09-15):
  * [dev] Makefile improvements; various other behind-the-scenes tweaks.

* **[v0.2.4](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.3...v0.2.4)** (2015-07-08):
  * [fix] Pass-through option-arguments with embedded spaces are now handled correctly; process substitution replaced with alternative so as to improve FreeBSD compatibility.
  * [doc] Read-me improved, notably: manual-installation instructions added, TOC added.

* **[v0.2.3](https://github.com/mklement0/shall/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)** (2015-06-26):
  * [doc] Read-me: npm badge changed to [shields.io](http://shields.io); license badge added; typo fixed.
  * [dev] To-do added; Makefile updated.

* **v0.2.2** (2015-05-31):
  * [doc] [npm registry badge](https://badge.fury.io) added

* **v0.2.1** (2015-05-27):
  * [fix] Options passed through with -p are no longer ignored on Linux.
  * [fix] Removed extraneous status output.

* **v0.2.0** (2015-05-24):
  * [new] New -p option allows passing additional options through to the shells invoked; e.g.: -p '-e'
  * [deprecated] -l option for specifying shells to target renamed to -w to avoid confusion with shells' native -l version (login shells); -l will continue to work. 
  * [robustness] Exit codes relating to shall's *own* failures changed to: 126 (incorrect arguments) and 127 (unexpected failure), chosen so as to avoid clashes with exit codes produced during normal operation and termination by signal.

* **v0.1.7** (2015-02-11):
  * [doc] improved description in package.json
